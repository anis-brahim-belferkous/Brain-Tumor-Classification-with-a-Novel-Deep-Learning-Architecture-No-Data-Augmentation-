# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-a-Novel-Deep-Learning-Architecture-No-Data-Augmentation-
This Python project implements a novel deep learning architecture for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. It focuses on achieving high accuracy without relying on data augmentation techniques.

Key Features:

* Unique Architecture: The core strength lies in a custom-designed deep learning model specifically tailored for brain tumor classification. This architecture leverages recent advancements in deep learning research to extract robust features from MRI scans. (Provide more specific details about the architecture's components and innovations here, if possible.)
* Four-Class Classification: The model is trained to distinguish between four distinct brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor (healthy brain).
* No Data Augmentation: This project intentionally avoids utilizing data augmentation techniques. This allows for a more controlled evaluation of the model's performance on raw MRI scans without the potential biases introduced by augmentation.
